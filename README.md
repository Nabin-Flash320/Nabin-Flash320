## Projects

### [EzloPi](https://github.com/ezloteam/Ezlo_Pi)
**Tools: ESP-IDF, C**
- Developed firmware for EzloPi, a collaborative open-source project developed by Ezlo Innovation.
- ADC, UART implementation in the project
- Driver implementation for sensors such as DHT22, DS18B20, Dimmable lamp, etc.
- API integration, captive portal, mDNS implentation, etc.

### Smart Shopping Cart
**Tools: Arduino, Arduino IDE, Python, Django, PyQt, RaspberryPi, Weight sensor, RFID, RaspberryPi camera**
- Developed a shopping cart capable of automatically detecting humans using RFID and image processing techniques.
- Enabled the cart to scan and register shopped items, sharing the list with the system.
- Implemented an automatic checkout system that integrates with the cart.
- Facilitated payment through a system-generated QR code.
- Shopping cart UI using PyQt and image detection using OpenCV, for RaspberryPi LCD.[[Link](https://github.com/Nabin-Flash320/Cart-UI)]
- Login and Checkout system implementation using django and SQlite.[[Link](https://github.com/Nabin-Flash320/shopsite)]

### Health Monitoring Band
**Tools: Arduino, Arduino IDE, Pulse sensor, Bluetooth**
- Developed a wearable wristwatch capable of measuring pulse rate and temperature.
- Enabled Bluetooth connectivity for syncing with mobile phones and sending notifications to a registered number.
- Presented the project at "Sagarmatha Tech Fest," securing first place.
- The project was also featured in the "KEC Conference" publication.

### Earth-O-Help
**Tools: RaspberryPi, RaspberryPi camera, Arduino, Arduino IDE, Ultrasonic sensor, Websocket, Pytorch**
- Collaborated with three teammates on this minor project, which involved designing two robots: a primary and a secondary robot.
- The robots were built to navigate disaster-stricken areas and search for trapped humans.
- Human detection capabilities were integrated using various sensors, including sound and ultrasonic sensors.
- The robots provided live footage of the surroundings to assist in rescue operations.
- The project focused on enhancing search and rescue missions through autonomous robotic navigation and detection.

### [ESP OTA using GitHub releases](https://github.com/Nabin-Flash320/esp-ota-using-github)
**Tools: ESP-IDF, C, GitHub**
- Over The Air(OTA) update of the ESP device firmware using binaries in GitHub release.
- Project is capable of getting OTA updates with target repository being a private repository.

### [LCD interface using ESP32 and LVGL](https://github.com/Nabin-Flash320/LCD_Project)
**Tools: ESP-IDF, LVGL, C**
- Interfacing the ILI9486 display(380x480) with 8-bit I80 interface using LVGL library in ESP-IDF.

### [Shorting algorithm in C++](https://github.com/Nabin-Flash320/c-Graphics)
**Tools: C++**
- Using graphics.h library bubble, insertion, selection and quick shorts were visualized.

### [Wrapper for BLE server and client](https://github.com/Nabin-Flash320/ESP-BLE)
**Tools: ESP-IDF, C, BLE**
- Created a wrapper for BLE in ESP-IDF, making it easier to implement GATT attributes in server and connect to the read attributes from the server and connect to server, in client.
